# FPGA HDMI Project
 Creating an HDMI output using a Cyclone V FPGA to display a rudimentry spectrum analyzer on any HDMI display.
 
 Using System Verilog the HDMI output was created fully within hardware. Seamus Finlayson created the DFT within hardware to display a rudimentry spectrum analysis of an input signal on the HDMI screen.
 The code for encoding the hdmi signal was found on fpga4fun.com.
